## Stepper Shield

This is a simple 3 axis stepper motor Arduino Shield for the [DRV8825 Step Stick](https://reprapworld.com/datasheets/datasheet%20drv8825.pdf). 
It works with [GRBL](https://github.com/grbl/grbl) on an [Aruduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) or [TinyG](https://github.com/synthetos/g2) on an [Arduino Due](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-due). 
The circuit board for this shield is single-sided and can be milled on a precision CNC machine using a 1/32" endmill.

There are two designs. One design uses DIP holes for the through hole components and the other design has larger holes for copper rivets. (see images below)
